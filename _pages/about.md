I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [KAIST Visual AI Group](https://kaist-visual-ai-group.github.io), headed by [Prof. Minhyuk Sung](https://mhsung.github.io). I earned my B.S. degree in Computer Science (Major) and Electrical Engineering (Minor) from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in Aug. 2023 and my M.S. degree in Computer Science from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in Feb. 2025.

My research interest encompasses various computational problems arising from the intersection of computer graphics and vision. In particular, my research area includes but is not limited to:
- Generative Modeling for 3D Data;
- AI for Science;
- Multimodal 3D Data Manipulation;
- Geometry Processing.

I am an M.S. student at [KAIST Visual AI Group](https://kaist-visual-ai-group.github.io) headed by [Prof. Minhyuk Sung](https://mhsung.github.io). I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science (Major) and Electrical Engineering (Minor) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in Aug. 2023.

My research interest encompasses various computational problems arising from the intersection of computer graphics and vision. In particular, my research area includes but is not limited to:
- Generative Modeling for 3D Data;
- 3D Reconstruction;
- Multimodal 3D Data Manipulation;
- Geometry Processing.

For details, refer to my [Curriculum Vitae (PDF)](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).

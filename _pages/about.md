Hi, I'm Seungwoo Yoo, an incoming M.S. student at [KAIST Geometric AI Lab](https://mhsung.github.io) headed by Prof. Minhyuk Sung. I will be graduating with a B.S. degree in Computer Science (Major) and Electrical Engineering (Minor) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in Aug. 2023.

My research interest encompasses various computational problems arising from the intersection of computer graphics and vision. In particular, my research area includes but is not limited to:
- Generative Modeling for 3D Data
- 3D Reconstruction
- Multimodal 3D Data Manipulation
- Geometry Processing

For details, refer to my [Curriculum Vitae (PDF)](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
